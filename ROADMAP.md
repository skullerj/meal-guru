# Meal Guru — Roadmap

**Vision:** Get someone to their shopping list in under 30 seconds with no decisions required.

**Core scenario:** It's Monday, you're near the supermarket, you forgot to plan. You open the app, tap one button, get a shopping list, and walk in. The planning UI (manual recipe picker) is a power-user escape hatch — not the primary flow.

Old code is preserved on the `archive/v1` branch for reference.
